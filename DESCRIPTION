Description: An implementation of the functional ANOVA test described in "Nonparametric 
    comparisons of activity profiles from wear- able device data" by Chang et. al. The
    test takes activity data from groups of subjects and incorporates a nonparametric
    likelihood ratio approach to provide a simultaneous confidence band and functional
    ANOVA test for the mean of activity profiles.
